    <p align="center"><strong>Good</strong> <em>lemonade</em> can be any variety of sweetened or unsweetened beverages found throughout the world, which are
        traditionally all characterized by a lemon flavor.[1]
        <!-- This is a comment -->

        Most lemonade varieties can be separated into two distinct types: cloudy and clear; each is known simply as
        "lemonade" (or a cognate) in countries where dominant.[2][self-published source?] Cloudy lemonade, generally
        found in North America and South Asia, is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a
        sweetener such as cane sugar, a simple syrup (white sugar and water) or honey.[3] In the United Kingdom and
        Australia, clear lemonade, which is typically also carbonated, dominates.[2]

        The suffix "-ade" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade,
        orangeade, or cherryade.[4]</p>
